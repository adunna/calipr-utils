## Getting Started

Clone the repository, which by default will have available R code and LaTeX code. There will be some scripts you can run to obtain datasets as well, and installation scrips for useful R and Python packages.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 (and pip), LaTeX, and R.

### Installing

`git clone https://github.com/adunna/calipr-utils.git`

To install various pip packages (Python 3, assuming pip3 is installed), use the included `pip-packages.sh` script with root privileges, as `sudo ./pip-packages.sh`.
